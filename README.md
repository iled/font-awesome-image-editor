=========================

14N icons for image editor applications.

Just 11 icons for image editing applications (personally I was creating one based on the excellent http://fabricjs.com/kitchensink/).

The icons are:

* Send Backward
* Send to Back
* Bring to Front
* Bring Forward
* Line Thickness
* Cursor
* Transparency
* Flip Vertical 
* Flip Horizontal
* Text Colour
* Text Background Colour

The icons were created in Illustrator, saved as SVG then compiled to a font using http://icomoon.io/.
